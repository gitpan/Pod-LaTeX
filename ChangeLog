	* Version 0.54 on CPAN

	* LaTeX.pm (verbatim): Use a cleverer approach to tabs. (Hugh S
	Myers <hughmyers@micron.com>)
	(_replace_special_chars_late): verbar escape was happening in the
	wrong place and this was ruining link expansion.
	(add_item): Tweak so that we for long items we have some content
	in the item description itself and some bold. This makes sure that
	everything lines up. (thanks to Hugh S Myers for the original idea
	and for the _split_delimited method).
