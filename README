Pod::LaTeX - convert Pod to latex using Pod::Parser

This is the first public release of Pod::LaTeX. This module can be used to
convert pod data to latex. It uses the standard Pod::Parser module.
A pod2latex replacement command is provided. This can be installed over
the pod2latex command distributed with perl.

It could be considered to be in a beta state since it has only been
tested by me.

Please let me know of any problems.

INSTALLATION

 % perl Makefile.PL
 % make
 % make test
 % make install

Currently the tests are not very good (only a simple test is provided).

REQUIREMENTS

Requires perl 5.005 or newer.

Written completely in Perl. XS is not required.

Requires the PodParser package from CPAN. This is standard with
perl 5.6.0.
