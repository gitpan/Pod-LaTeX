This is version 0.54 of Pod::LaTeX. This module can be used to
convert pod data to latex. It uses the standard Pod::Parser module.

the pod2latex command distributed with perl.

Please let me know of any problems.

 % make install

Currently the tests are not very good (only a simple test is provided).

Written completely in Perl. XS is not required.

Requires the PodParser package from CPAN. This is standard with
perl 5.6.0.
